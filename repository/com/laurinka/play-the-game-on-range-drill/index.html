  <p>On the practice tee, visualize a course you know well and "play" an entire nine or 18 holes [minus putts]. If the first "hole" calls for driver, then 6-iron, then wedge, hit those clubs in succession; choose a specific target for each shot, and follow your normal pre-shot routine. This drill makes you hit your clubs in random order, just as you would on the course, and it also helps you work on visualization. Turn it into a game. Give yourself a score -- one point for a quality swing, zero for each so-so shot, and minus-one for poor shots [tops, chunks, etc.]. Your goal? Beat the previous score by at least one point.</p>

    Play a round of golf on the range. Visualising everything. One point for every good shot, zero points for a so-so shot and -1 for poor shot.
