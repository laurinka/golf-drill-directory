<h1>The drill</h1>

<p>
1. Place a coin about 3 balls in front of the golf ball you are about to hit on your
target line

2. The idea here is to make contact with the coin after you hit the ball

3. This will teach you how to make the correct contact with the surface and give
you better ball striking

4. If done correctly, the club should make contact with the ball and then brush the
coin off the surface

5. A small divot here is ok as well as long as you continue to brush the club along
the ground after impact

6. Try hitting 10-20 small chip shots now making contact with the coin as often as
possible</p>
