Take your normal grip and then simply remove your trail hand and place it\nbehind your back (as shown in video)\n\n3. Take a few short practice swings whilst really concentrating on maintaining\nshaft lean at impact\n\n4. Really concentrate on keeping your lead wrist strong through impact (as shown\nin video)\n\n5. If done correctly the club should remain parallel to your lead wrist at the end of\nyour follow through\n\n6. Once confident, begin to hit a few short chip shots using this new technique\nwhilst maintaining that strong lead wrist</p>"
