  <h1>Preparations</h1>
  <p>Take two clubs and put the parallel each other on the ground. They should be wide enough so that you can make a stroke with your putter inside them.</p>

  <h1>The drill</h1>

  <p>Place 10 balls at one end, swing putter straight back and you should not hit clubs with your ball, balls should leave the other end (or enter a hole at the other end). </p>
