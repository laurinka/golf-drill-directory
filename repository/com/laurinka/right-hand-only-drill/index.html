<h1>The drill</h1>

<p>
1.  Take a neutral set up position with a ball slightly in front of your sternum

2. Take your normal grip and then simply remove your lead hand and place it on
your trail bicep (as shown in video)

3. Take a few short practice swings whilst really concentrating on maintaining
shaft lean at impact

4. If done correctly, the club should be directly in line with your trail arm in the
finish position (as shown in video)

5. Once confident, begin to hit a few short chip shots using this new technique
whilst maintaining that shaft lean at impact</p>
