  "data": "  How to practise at home:\n1. Take a neutral set up position with a ball slightly in front of your sternum\n\n2. Now take a club you are comfortable chipping with and instead of using a\nconventional grip, place your lead hand below your trail hand\n\n3. Take a few small practice swings to become comfortable with the feeling of\nholding the club this way\n\n4. Once you feel confident, hit a ball 5-10 yards and try to feel that your shaft is\nleaning forward whilst also hitting the turf after contact with the ball\n\n5. Now hit 10-20 small chip shots still maintaining the same grip (lead hand low)\nreally trying to feel that shaft lean and making solid impact"
