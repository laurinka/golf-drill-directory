<h1>The drill</h1>

<p>
  How to practise at home:
1. Take a neutral set up position with a ball slightly in front of your sternum

2. Take your normal grip and then simply remove your trail hand and place it
behind your back (as shown in video)

3. Take a few short practice swings whilst really concentrating on maintaining
shaft lean at impact

4. Really concentrate on keeping your lead wrist strong through impact (as shown
in video)

5. If done correctly the club should remain parallel to your lead wrist at the end of
your follow through

6. Once confident, begin to hit a few short chip shots using this new technique
whilst maintaining that strong lead wrist</p>
