<h1>The drill</h1>

<ul> Take your normal start position and
produce a regular swing but stop
just before you hit the ball</ul>

<ul> Hold that position with your chest
centred, head centred and pelvis
centred</ul>

<ul> Your task is to now move the ball
forward without a backswing</ul>

<ul>If you have a good body position,
the ball will travel between 20-40
yards</ul>

<ul>The further you can “throw” the ball,
the better the relationship between
your hands, arms and body</ul>

<ul>This is a difficult drill to master at
first so don’t be discouraged if you
find it difficult</ul>

<ul>Try catapulting between 15-20 golf
balls or until you are consistently
pushing the ball over 20 yards</ul>
