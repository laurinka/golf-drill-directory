  <h1>Preparations</h1>
  <p>Find a hole on a golf course where you can practice</p>

  <h1>The drill</h1>

  <p>Start 40 meters from the hole and hit a shot to the green. If you hit the green go 10 meters further away from the hole, if you didn't hit the green you go 10 meters towards the hole. Stop once you reach 200 meters.</p>
