<h1>The drill</h1>

<p>
  How to practise at home:
1. Take a neutral set up position with a ball slightly in front of your sternum

2. Now take a club you are comfortable chipping with and instead of using a
conventional grip, place your lead hand below your trail hand

3. Take a few small practice swings to become comfortable with the feeling of
holding the club this way

4. Once you feel confident, hit a ball 5-10 yards and try to feel that your shaft is
leaning forward whilst also hitting the turf after contact with the ball

5. Now hit 10-20 small chip shots still maintaining the same grip (lead hand low)
really trying to feel that shaft lean and making solid impact
