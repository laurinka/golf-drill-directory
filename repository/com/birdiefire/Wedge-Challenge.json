    "Beginning at 40 yards from a small target green, place 3 balls every 10 yards back to 11 yards. You will hit one ball from a yardage with a full pre-shot routine, and you may begin from any yardage. You will change yardages on every shot in a random order. Keep track of how many shots out of 40 that you hit the target green."
