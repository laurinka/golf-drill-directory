    "Pick 2 targets approx 120 and 150 yards away (preferably target greens) and set up 20 golf balls. Take 1 club more than you would normally hit from 120 yards away and grip down on the club 1/2 inch to 1and hit it to the 120 yard green. For example, if PW is yournormal120 yard club, take your 9 iron and grip down on it to hit 10 shots to the target green. Do the same thing for 150 yards by taking 1 club more than you would normally hit and gripping down on it, and hit the 10 balls to the 150 yard target. Keep track of how many times your hit the target green for a total score out of 20. This drill will help you with in-between club shots and into the wind shots."
