    "Place 5 balls in 10 yard increments starting at 40 yards from a target green and go back to 110 yards. Hit all 5 balls at 40 yards and then move back to 50, 60, 70, etc. Keep track of the total number of balls that hit the green. Your goal is to get 24 out of 40 on the green to begin with, and gradually moving that number up to 32 or higher. The better you are with your wedge and short iron approach shots, the better your scores will be!"
